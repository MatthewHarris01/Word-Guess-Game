# Word-Guess-Game
user Plays a word-guessing game with the computer, similar to hangman.
Version 0.15  html page started, css started, javascript code started. At this point the code can start the game and initialize display info for user and computer info, such as display the computer's word.
The html page design is mostly complete, and has fair responsive behavior.
