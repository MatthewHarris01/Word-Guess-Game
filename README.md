# Word-Guess-Game
user Plays a word-guessing game with the computer, similar to hangman.
Version 1.0  html page started, css started, javascript code started. At this point the code can start the game and initialize display info for user and computer info, such as display the computer's word.
The html page design is mostly complete, and has fair responsive behavior.
0.14 -added win and lose sounds, however there is an issue with their play, they do not currently play, and i am uncertain why not.
Added Myer web reset css content.
0.16 -- most stuff is working, currently working on getting the matched letters to display correctly.
0.17 -- the reveal matched letters code is almost working, still has a couple of bugs to resolve.
0.2 -- code to reveal matched letter complete and working. Needs code to determine if player has won. (some placeholder elements installed, but workng code not built.)
1.0 -- game now successfully detects win.
SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS: the "player wins" flourishes could use some improvement.
KNOWN ISSUES: The player win and lose sounds do not play.
