# Word-Guess-Game
user Plays a word-guessing game with the computer, similar to hangman.
Version 1.2  html page completeed, css completed, javascript code completeed. At this point code can start the game, display user guesses, and determine a player win or loss. Hint system added.
0.14 -added win and lose sounds, however there is an issue with their play, they do not currently play, and i am uncertain why not.
0.16 -- most stuff is working, matched letters display correctly.
0.17 -- the reveal matched letters code is working, still has a couple of bugs to resolve.
0.2 -- code to reveal matched letter complete and working. Needs code to determine if player has won. (some placeholder elements installed, but workng code not built.)
1.0 -- game now successfully detects win.
1.1 -- Hint system added, and still under development. Bug related to "press any key to start" after game auto-restart resolved.
1.2 -- Hint system completed and tested.
SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS: the "player wins" flourishes could use some improvement.
KNOWN ISSUES: The player win and lose sounds do not play. Page is not responsive. Final letter(s) of user guess is not displayed when user completes the word.
